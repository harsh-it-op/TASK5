# Python Data Structures and Strings Assignment

This repository contains solutions for Assignment 5, covering Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python. The assignment includes two tasks demonstrating dictionary operations and list slicing.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Student Marks Dictionary
This program demonstrates dictionary operations in Python:
- Creates a dictionary with student names as keys and their marks as values
- Allows user to input a student's name
- Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks
- Handles cases where the student is not found

**File:** `task1.py`

### Task 2: List Slicing Demonstration
This program demonstrates list operations in Python:
- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10
- Extracts the first five elements
- Reverses these extracted elements
- Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list

**File:** `task2.py`
